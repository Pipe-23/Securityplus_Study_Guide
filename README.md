CompTIA community advice

Engaging in to cybersecurity: "Not sure if that had stuck if I hadn't been interested in Security long before I started studying for the Sec+. For years I've been watching Blackhat keynotes, reading articles about breaches, I get alerts from NIST, CISA, and Google alerts about breaches and ransomware attacks. I play around with basic pen testing tools, have a home lab, have taken a crap load of Cybrary courses, and so on and so on".

Leo Laporte/TWIT and Steve Gibson: "Leo Laporte/TWIT or even Steve Gibson (although a somewhat hard to follow guy. An obvious high IQ type)"

Study Materials: "Study bank by Chapple and seidl, prof dion practice quizzes, Quizlet to memorize port numbers and dojolabs to work on the simulated labs".

Things to memorize: "Immediately write down your notes from the flash cards on the white board. Especially the OSI model and ports, how to calculate ARO, SLE, EF and Cryptography sections. Remember: integrity=hash. And the CIA TRIAD, and AES=ccmp".

About multiple choice questions: "I skipped the PBQ's [at the beginning of the test] like everyone says to".
